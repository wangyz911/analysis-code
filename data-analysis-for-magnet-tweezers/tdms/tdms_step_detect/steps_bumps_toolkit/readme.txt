ZIP file contents:

l1pwc.m
 - L1PWC (Total Variation Denoising) algorithm, as described in [2].

l1pwcar1.m
 - L1PWC-AR1 algorithm. Equivalent to Total Variation Denoising where the original
   input signal has specified autocorrelation at time lag 1. Algorithm described in
   [2].

l1pwclmax.m
 - Code to calculate the maximum useful value of lambda for the l1pwc algorithm.

ckfilter.m
 - An implementation of the Chung-Kennedy nonlinear filter. Algorithm described
   in [4] above.
   
kvsteps.m
 - A Matlab implementation of the Kalafut-Visscher step extraction algorithm,
   described in [3] above.

kvsteps_core.c
 - Matlab MEX code to implement the Kalafut-Visscher step extraction algorithm,
   called by kvsteps.m

kvsteps_core.mexw32
 - Above code compiled for Windows 32-bit platforms.

kvsteps_core.mexw64
 - Above code compiled for Windows 64-bit platforms.

ecf.m
 - Calculate the Empirical Characteristic Function (ECF) of a given time series, as
   described in [2].

ecf2pdf.m
 - Converts the ECF to the associated probability density function (PDF),
   as described in [2].

ecfshrink.m
 - Calculates the ECF of a time series, applies nonlinear (and/or linear) shrinkage
   to the coefficients, and then reconstructs the PDF. This algorithm is described
   in [2].

bfmsim.m
 - Generates simulated time series of stepping bacterial motors, as described in the
   supplementary material in [2].

exp2fit.m
 - Uses the method of moments to estimate the two rate constants of a double
   exponential distribution, as described in the supplementary material in [2].

exp2like.m
 - Calculates the negative log likelihood of a double exponential distribution model
   for a time series with two given rate constants. See supplementary material in [2].

exp2pdf.m
 - Evaluates the PDF of a double exponential distribution at the given values of
   the random variable with the given rate constants. See supplementary material
   in [2].

exp2rnd.m
 - Generates random numbers distributed according to a double exponential distribution
   with the given rate constants. See [2] for more details.

exp2stat.m
 - Calculates the mean and standard deviation of a double exponential distribution
   given the two rate constants. See [2] for more details.
